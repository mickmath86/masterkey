            This scorecard is designed to help buyers evaluate where to live in Thousand Oaks, 
            not just which home to purchase. Each area is assessed using the same framework so 
            buyers can clearly understand lifestyle tradeoffs, strengths, and limitations before 
            narrowing their search.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scores are relative within Thousand Oaks. All areas are strong—lower scores simply 
            reflect different buyer priorities and tradeoffs, not deficiencies.
