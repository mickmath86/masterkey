# Your Complete New Landlord Guide

Thinking about renting out your property? Becoming a landlord is equal parts opportunity and responsibility. Done right, it can produce steady cash flow, long‑term appreciation, and valuable tax benefits. Done hastily, it can lead to compliance issues, vacancy, and avoidable costs.

- Establish the right ownership/insurance setup (LLC or personal, plus proper landlord coverage)
- Confirm legal requirements and disclosures for your state/locality
- Draft a clear, compliant lease and addendums (pets, utilities, house rules)
- Bring the home to rent‑ready condition (safety, systems, deep clean, photos)
- Price using current comps and market trends; prep your listing and marketing plan
- Define objective tenant screening criteria; apply consistently and document decisions
- Set up rent collection, bookkeeping, maintenance workflows, and emergency contacts
