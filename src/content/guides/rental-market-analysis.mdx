**Success Factor:** Properties priced correctly based on market analysis rent 50% faster than those priced arbitrarily.

## Key Market Analysis Components

### 1. Comparable Property Research

Identify properties similar to yours by:

**Location Criteria:**
- Within 1-mile radius
- Same neighborhood or school district
- Similar demographics and amenities

**Property Characteristics:**
- Bedrooms and bathrooms
- Square footage (±200 sq ft)
- Age and condition
- Parking and amenities

### 2. Data Collection Methods

**Online Resources:**

- MLS rental data
- Property management company websites
- Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace

**Field Research:**
- Drive-by property assessments
- Mystery shopping competitor properties
- Networking with local agents and managers
- Attending open houses

## Analyzing Market Data

### Rent Price Analysis

Create a comparison spreadsheet including:

| Property Address | Bed/Bath | Sq Ft | Rent | Per Sq Ft | Amenities | Days on Market |
|------------------|----------|--------|------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 123 Main St | 2/2 | 1,200 | $1,800 | $1.50 | Pool, Gym | 15 |
| 456 Oak Ave | 2/2 | 1,150 | $1,750 | $1.52 | Parking | 8 |

### Market Trends to Track

**Seasonal Patterns:**

- Off-season pricing adjustments
- Student housing cycles (if applicable)

**Economic Indicators:**
- Local employment rates
- Population growth
- New construction projects
- Transportation developments

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

### Absorption Rate Calculation

**Formula:** Number of units rented divided by Total available units multiplied by 100

- **High absorption (greater than 85%):** Strong demand, consider rent increases
- **Moderate absorption (70-85%):** Balanced market
- **Low absorption (less than 70%):** Oversupply, competitive pricing needed

### Price Per Square Foot Analysis

This metric helps normalize comparisons:
- Calculate: Monthly rent divided by Square footage
- Compare across similar properties
- Identify pricing opportunities
